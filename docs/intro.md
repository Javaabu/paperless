# Paperless
### Application workflow handling on steroids

## Introduction
This package lets you create application workflows with ease. 
Most of the heavy lifting is done by the package itself. You are only required to define the following:
- Application Type
  - Fields
  - Service class (normally you would only write the business logic associated with the approval step here)
Then you can seed the database and you are good to go.

This package is built to be flexible and extensible. You can easily add new statuses and fields to the package as per your requirements.
