## Creating An Application Type Category
Application types are grouped together using categories. Therefore, before you can create an application type, you need to create a category. 
To create a new category, you can use the following command:

```bash
php artisan paperless:category
```
The command will ask you for the slug of the category and the label. The slug is used to identify the category in the database.
